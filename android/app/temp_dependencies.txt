    // However, the plugin usually handles this. The user snippet was for specific languages.
    // For now I'll skip adding specific implementations because the plugin handles the bundled model.
    // But I will add the block just in case I need it later or for other configs.
    // Actually, I'll invoke the plugin's transitive dependencies.
